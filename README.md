## E-commerce Business Model for Carol's Whimsy

### Overview
Carol's Whimsy intends to become an online B2C (Business-to-Consumer) platform specializing in the resale of festive decoration goods and gifts, sourced from the B2B provider [Goodwill, Belgium](https://goodwill.be/en/home-eng/). 

The platform focuses on seasonal decorations for Christmas, Easter, and Halloween, targeting the UK market. The business model is designed to leverage the convenience of online shopping to reach a broad audience, offering a diverse range of products such as ornaments, figures, home decor, dolls, flowers, branches, trees, wreaths, balls, and baubles etc.

### Choosing Brand Name
The draft Brand Name or trademark was chosen by its versatility as to Christmas and Easter whereas the word "whimsy" adds a playful and enchanting feel, suitable for a boutique offering unique and festive decorations. The team conducted the trademark search and at the moment the search gives negative result to the favor of the chosen name:

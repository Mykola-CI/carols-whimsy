## E-commerce Business Model for Carol's Whimsy

### Overview
Carol's Whimsy intends to become an online B2C (Business-to-Consumer) platform specializing in the resale of festive decoration goods and gifts, sourced from the B2B provider [Goodwill, Belgium](https://goodwill.be/en/home-eng/). 

The platform focuses on seasonal decorations for Christmas, Easter, and Halloween, targeting the UK market. The business model is designed to leverage the convenience of online shopping to reach a broad audience, offering a diverse range of products such as ornaments, figures, home decor, dolls, flowers, branches, trees, wreaths, balls, and baubles etc.

### Choosing Brand Name
The draft Brand Name or trademark was chosen by its versatility as to Christmas and Easter whereas the word "whimsy" adds a playful and enchanting feel, suitable for a boutique offering unique and festive decorations. The team conducted the trademark search and at the moment the search gives negative result to the favor of the chosen name:

![UK GOV trademark search](documentation/marketing/carolswhimsyIPO.png)

The relevant domains have also been secured:

![Carol's Whimsy Domains](documentation/marketing/registered_domains.png)


### Purpose and Core Business Intents
- **Direct-to-Consumer Sales:**

The primary purpose of Carol's Whimsy is to sell decorative goods directly to consumers through an online platform. This approach allows for a direct relationship with the end-user, facilitating personalized marketing and customer engagement strategies.

- **Seasonal Product Offering:** 

By focusing on festive decorations, Carol's Whimsy can capitalize on seasonal demand spikes, ensuring a steady flow of customers during peak holiday seasons.


- **Wide Product Range:**

Offering a comprehensive range of decorative items ensures that customers can find everything they need for their festive decoration needs in one place, enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases.

### Marketing Strategies
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** 

Implementing robust SEO strategies will enhance online visibility, driving organic traffic to the website. This includes optimizing product descriptions, using relevant keywords, and ensuring the website is mobile-friendly.

I conducted the search for keywords using google search prompts and [Moz keyword explorer](https://moz.com/explorer).\
<ins>Relevant topics identified in the order of priority:</ins>\
1. Christmas Ornaments & gifts
2. Easter Decorations
3. Halloween Gifts
4. Seasonal Home Decor

<ins>Keyword ideas found and shortlisted.</ins>\
short-tail:  Christmas decorations, Christmas tree decorations, homebase Christmas decorations, Christmas sale, Christmas ornaments, Christmas baubles, Christmas trees, Christmas home decorations, luxury Christmas decorations, Christmas decor, Easter eggs, Easter gifts, Easter decorations, halloween gifts\
long-tail: Easter egg decorating kits, handmade Christmas tree ornaments, unique Halloween gift ideas, affordable seasonal home decor for holidays 

The keywords are implanted into meta tags as well as scattered around the app, most of them on the landing page and About Us pages

MOZ Keyword search for Easter related topics:
![MOZ search for Easter keywords](documentation/marketing/keywords_easter_moz.png)

- **Social Media Marketing:** 

Utilizing platforms like Instagram and Facebook to showcase products and engage with customers. Social media campaigns can highlight new arrivals, seasonal collections, and special promotions.

The relevant pages are created on Facebook and Instagram for Carol's Whimsy:\

[Carol's Whimsy Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/carolswhimsy.deco/?hl=en)

The FB screenshot archive: [here](documentation/marketing/fbcarols-mobile.pdf)

Youtube, X and Telegram remain unattended at the moment.

- **Email Marketing:** 

Building an email list to send targeted promotions, newsletters, and personalized recommendations to customers. This strategy helps in maintaining customer engagement and encouraging repeat purchases.

I set up a subscription form at the footer with large eye-catching title and I signed up for MailChimp services. 

![Footer subscribe section](documentation/marketing/subscribe_section_footer.png)

![MailChamp Accounts](documentation/marketing/mailchimp_accounts.png)
 

- **Customer Loyalty Programs:** 

Introducing loyalty programs to reward repeat customers with discounts or exclusive access to new products. This can increase customer retention and lifetime value.

The platform is now ready for distribution of newsletter with new deals, bundle offers, promo codes and the likes. A registered customer can acquire and apply promo codes right away and get discount on the cart totals:

![Promo Code Demo](documentation/marketing/promo_code_demo.png)

__Note.__ Current Promo Code for testing purposes at the moment is CAROLS-WHIMSY-START . Needs to register first.


### Implications for the E-commerce Platform
- **User Experience:** 

The platform is designed using Django, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap 5 to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience across devices. This is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and reducing cart abandonment rates.

- **Scalability:** 

The e-commerce platform must be scalable to handle increased traffic during peak seasons. This involves optimizing server resources and ensuring robust backend support.

- **Data Analytics:** 

Implementing analytics tools to track customer behavior, sales trends, and marketing campaign effectiveness. This data will inform business decisions and marketing strategies, helping to optimize operations and improve customer targeting.

- **Security and Payment Processing:** 

Ensuring secure transactions through reliable payment gateways and adhering to data protection regulations to build customer trust.

## Disclaimer

- **Initial Project Phase:** This project represents the foundational stage of a future business venture. It serves as a prototype for the envisioned commercial platform, providing a basis for further development and refinement.
- **Incomplete Feature Set:** Given the constraints of time, the project is not yet fully realized. While it includes essential features to initiate commercial operations, there are numerous enhancements required to reach a fully operational and comprehensive platform. It is designed to evolve and expand over time.
- **Priority Future Developments:** Key features that need to be prioritized in future iterations include:
  - <ins>Customer ratings and reviews</ins> to enhance user engagement and trust.
  - <ins>Advanced filtering options</ins> and faceted navigation to improve product discoverability.
  - <ins>Stock availability control</ins> to mark out-of-stock items and ensure customer is alerted on delivery terms.
  - <ins>Efficient customer contact handling</ins> to facilitate communication and support.

- **Non-Realistic Pricing:**\
The prices displayed in Carol's catalog are placeholders and do not reflect actual market values.
- **Non-Realistic Star Rating:**\
The star ratings as well as a number of votes displayed in the Carol's catalog and the Product Detail view are placeholders and do not reflect actual ratings. For now they are for the front end demonstration only and must be implemented as a functionality in future. 
- **Payment in Test Mode**\
Meaning it is fictitious. Payments are made in simulation mode arranged by Stripe for testing. Using Stripe test card numbers. Here some of them can be tried:

| Card Type | Card Number | Action |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Valid card | 5555 5582 6555 4449 | payment successful |
| Generic decline	            | 4000 0000 0000 0002 |	card_declined |
| Insufficient funds decline	| 4000 0000 0000 9995	| card_declined	| 


- **Fictitious Contact Information:**\
The contact details provided for the shop are fictional and intended solely for demonstration purposes.
- **Generic Informational Pages:**\
The "About Us" and "FAQ" pages contain generic content and will require detailed, specific information in future updates to accurately represent the business and address customer inquiries.

## User Stories

User stories as a guidance for the project can be found on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Mykola-CI/carols-whimsy/issues).\

### 404

![404page](documentation/manual_tests/404page.png)


## Data Modeling

Apart from all built-in django models or those of 3d party vendors like django-allauth I have to deploy 12 custom models to provide for the current levels of the application functionality.  
![ERD diagram](documentation/data_modeling/carols_schema.jpg)


### Brand, Category, Theme, Season

Technically these models are almost identical in structure and serve as quasi-categories altogether

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| name          | CharField | max_length=255, unique=True |
| friendly_name | CharField | max_length=254, null=True, blank=True |
| description | TextField | blank=True, null=True |

However, this kind of categorization is required by business model and the nature of merchandise to market.

### Product

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| name          | CharField | max_length=255 |
| sku | CharField | max_length=100, unique=True, blank=False |
| brand | ForeignKey | on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1, related_name='branded_products' |
| category | ForeignKey | on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1, related_name='group_of_products' |
| theme | ForeignKey | on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1, related_name='theme_products' |
| season | ForeignKey | on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1, related_name='season_products' |
| price | DecimalField | max_digits=6, decimal_places=2 |
| promo_text | TextField | blank=True, null=True |
| size | CharField | max_length=255, blank=True, null=True |
| material | CharField | blank=True, null=True |
| color | CharField | max_length=255, blank=True, null=True |
| other_details | TextField | blank=True, null=True |
| discount | DecimalField | max_digits=3, decimal_places=2, default=0, validators=[MinValueValidator(0), MaxValueValidator(1)] |
| image | ImageField | upload_to='', blank=True, null=True |
| image_url | URLField | max_length=1024, blank=True, null=True |

__NOTES__.
1. The discount field must be commented. It is the Decimal type of value with minimum and maximum limits : from 0 to 1.\
The backend logic treats it as a decimal discount ratio. For example, discount = 0.1 means 10% discount and the price after discount must be calculated:\
price = old_price * (1 - 0.1)
2. Import of data to excel.\
There are total of 286 products in the database at the moment. It is expected that the number is going to triple in the least.\
At that there will be some important challenges to deal with as to the processing time to deliver User's GET requests. For the time being there was only one micro challenge how to import that number of products to the database.\
Most of the time was spent on preparing contents for the Excel spreadsheets, especially the promo_text or product descriptions.
Then I used Pandas package to do the import.

The management files are located at '/products/management/commands/'.\
The spreadsheets themselves are at '/data/' 

### Order

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| order_number | CharField | max_length=32, null=False, editable=False |

| saving | DecimalField | max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, default=0 |
| order_total | DecimalField | max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, default=0 |
| grand_total | DecimalField |  max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, default=0 |
| original_cart | TextField | null=False, blank=False, default='' |
| stripe_pid | CharField |  max_length=254, unique=True, null=False, blank=False, default='' |
| status | CharField |  max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, null=False, blank=False, default='Pending' |

__NOTES__.
1. Status. It is defined by the choices:
~~~
STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('Pending', 'Pending'),
        ('Processing', 'Processing'),
        ('Shipped', 'Shipped'),
        ('Delivered', 'Delivered'),
        ('Cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
    ]
~~~
2. Saving. This field stores the discount information derived from the promo code application.

### OrderLineItem

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| order | ForeignKey |  Order, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='lineitems' |
| product | ForeignKey | Product, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| quantity | IntegerField | null=False, blank=False, default=0 |
| item_total | DecimalField | max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, null=False, blank=False, editable=False |

### UserProfile

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |

__NOTES__.\
Django Signal is used to create or update user profile whenever a new instance of User is created and/or updated.

### ShippingAddress

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| user_profile | ForeignKey | UserProfile, related_name='addresses', on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| delivery_first_name | CharField | max_length=50 |
| delivery_last_name | CharField  | max_length=50 | 
| delivery_phone_number | CharField  | max_length=20 | 
| delivery_email | EmailField  | max_length=254 | 
| shipping_street_address | CharField  | max_length=255 | 
| shipping_town_city | CharField  | max_length=40 | 
| shipping_county | CharField  | max_length=80 | 
| shipping_postcode | CharField  | max_length=20 | 
| shipping_country | CountryField  | blank_label='Country' | 
| shipping_is_default | BooleanField  | default=False | 

__NOTES__.
1. shipping_is_default: this name is self-explaining as it is to put a "default" tag on the address
2. The model has an intricate custom save method to ensure that if at least one address exists there is always a default and it is the only one.
~~~
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """ Override save method to set default shipping address
        to ensure there is only one default address per user"""

        if (
            not self.pk
                and ShippingAddress.objects.filter(
                    user_profile=self.user_profile).count() == 0):
            self.shipping_is_default = True
        elif self.shipping_is_default:
            # Set all other addresses for this user to non-default
            ShippingAddress.objects.filter(
                user_profile=self.user_profile, shipping_is_default=True
            ).update(shipping_is_default=False)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
~~~ 

### Wishlist

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| user | OneToOneField | User, on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| products | ManyToManyField | Product, blank=True |

__NOTES__. There is not much to say about this one. A user selects a product and saves it until further action is taken.

### CommercialConstant

This model allows the owner to set different values, such as, delivery percentage, delivery threshold, promocode key value pairs, even taxes or other rates if needed.

| Name          | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| name | CharField | max_length=50, unique=True |
| friendly_name | CharField | max_length=150, blank=True, null=True |
| value | CharField | max_length=255 |
| constant_type | CharField | max_length=5, choices=CONSTANT_TYPES |

    ]
2. The value derived from the field is defined by the `get_value` method:
~~~
 def get_value(self):
        if self.constant_type == 'int':
            return int(self.value)
        elif self.constant_type == 'float':
            return float(self.value) / 100
        return self.value
~~~

### PromoCodeUsage

## Credits

[Code Institute, Dublin](https://codeinstitute.net/) For the remarkable journey inside Boutique Ado chambers, especially for the Stripe pages, which logic I humbly dared to modify though.

[Cartzilla-Multipurpose E-Commerce Template](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/cartzilla-bootstrap-e-commerce-template-ui-kit/) inspired many macro and micro design ideas for most of the pages of Carol's Whimsy app. It was a real pleasure, sometimes a quest, good school and always a challenge to reach even half of their level of mastership.

[Swiper - Effect Coverflow](https://swiperjs.com/demos#effect-coverflow) is a main feature of the landing page. Working on Touchable Screens, mobiles and tablets.
